The build_toolchain.sh script is called by the main script (build_GNUBLIN_support_package) and installs the eldkv5 toolchain.

You should not run this script manually.









If you want to run it manually anyway, you should edit the script and enter definitions for two variables.

kernel_path=/PATH/WHERE/YOUR/KERNEL/DIRECTORY/IS/LOCATED
toolchain_path=/PATH/WHERE/YOUR/TOOLCHAIN/SHOULD/BE/INSTALLED
